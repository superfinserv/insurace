								<p data-aos="fade-right"><br>It is a law in India to buy  Insurance. Under Chapter 11 (Section 145 to 164) of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, it is compulsory to buy at least a Third-party Pvt Car Insurance Policy in India.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p data-aos="fade-left">Pvt Car insurance refers to the type of insurance policy that provides coverage against any damage that may occur to a pvt car vehicle, and/or its riders arising due to some unforeseen event such as road accidents, theft or natural disaster. It also provides protection against any liability that may arise due to injuries or damages caused to a third-party individual or property.
                                    Pvt Car insurance is an ideal solution to meet the ever-so-inflated repair costs that may arise due to the damages caused to the insured two-wheeler vehicles. In addition, car insurance plans provide protection to all types of pvt car vehicles including motorcycles, moped and scooters, and are available for all two-wheeler vehicles used for both, personal or commercial use.
