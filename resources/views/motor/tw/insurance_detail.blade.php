								<p data-aos="fade-right"><br>It is a law in India to buy  Insurance. Under Chapter 11 (Section 145 to 164) of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, it is compulsory to buy at least a Third-party Two-wheeler  Insurance Policy in India.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p data-aos="fade-left">Two-wheeler insurance refers to the type of insurance policy that provides coverage against any damage that may occur to a two-wheeler vehicle, and/or its riders arising due to some unforeseen event such as road accidents, theft or natural disaster. It also provides protection against any liability that may arise due to injuries or damages caused to a third-party individual or property.
                                    Two-wheeler insurance is an ideal solution to meet the ever-so-inflated repair costs that may arise due to the damages caused to the insured two-wheeler vehicles. In addition, bike insurance plans provide protection to all types of two-wheeler vehicles including motorcycles, moped and scooters, and are available for all two-wheeler vehicles used for both, personal or commercial use.
